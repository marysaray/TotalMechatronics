# Total Mechatronics BAS-META â€“ Bridge
*A course that provides an expedited analysis of the core disciplines utilized in mechatronics. The course serves as a refresher or introduction to the most important principles utilized within the realm of mechatronics including AC/DC circuits, motors and drives, PLC programming, digital electronics and networks, hydraulics and pneumatics, and mechanical systems.*

```
1. Devise solutions to broadly-defined engineering problems in complex
mechatronics systems through the application of knowledge, techniques, skills and
modern tools of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology.
2. Design systems, components, or processes meeting specified needs for broadly-
defined engineering problems for mechatronics systems.
3. Compose written, oral, and graphical communication in broadly-defined technical
and non-technical environments.
4. Evaluate appropriate technical literature for application in mechatronic systems;
5. Evaluate the results of standard tests, measurements, and experiments for the
improvement of processes, efficiency, and sustainability in mechatronic systems.
6. Build effective technical teams both as a member, as well as a leader
```
*LEARNING OUTCOMES, PROGRAM OUTCOMES AND CORE ABILITIES*
1. Manipulate system characteristics of
mechanical and fluid power systems.
2. Manipulate system characteristics of both
AC and DC circuits.
3. Construct basic control systems for
industrial applications.
4. Apply knowledge of schematics and
technical drawings to the construction of
mechatronic systems.
5. Integrate mechanical, fluid power, AC/DC
circuits, into a mechatronics system under
computerized control.

Final: SMSCP Exam

-- A focus on system understanding, troubleshooting, and problem-solving skills results in individuals who can adapt to new work situations quickly and appropriately.
